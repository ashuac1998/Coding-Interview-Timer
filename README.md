# Coding-Interview-Timer
A simple interview timer to help yourself prepare for coding interviews.

I have set the duration of 45 mins for myself and added alerts at these timestamps:

5th min -> Discussion time over.
15th min -> Problem Analysis time over.
40th min -> Coding time over.
0th min -> Follow up time over.
0th min -> Interview time over.

you can tune the code to adjust these values.

The components required for the hardware are:
1. Arduino
2. USB type B cable
3. Jumper wire
4. Electric buzzer
5. Push button
6. Potentiometer

The tutorial for setting up the dispaly and the button are:
